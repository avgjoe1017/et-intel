theheartisfree,"She ruined it. She decided two snakes were the best way to go, and in doing so destroyed what once made her relatable. Don’t blame others for your selfish, bad choices, Colleen. She took part in a film coup meant to destroy a man’s life and reputation. Karma happened to bite her, and now she blames both of them. No—blame your own greed and the snakes you aligned yourself with.

The book isn’t bad; you, as the author who chose money and power over integrity, were the problem. You’re pulling a J.K. Rowling right now.

annelinepuskas,"How ironic that the woman called Blake — who lied about being naked during a fake, acted birth — is now demanding a full, uncensored video of a woman who actually gave birth.
The audacity is wild. 😭💔
And the worst part? A moment that is meant to be so empowering and so sacred for us women — the moment we bring our babies into this world — is now going to end up on a legal docket for the entire globe to view.
I am heartbroken for Natasha, and for all of us as women.
