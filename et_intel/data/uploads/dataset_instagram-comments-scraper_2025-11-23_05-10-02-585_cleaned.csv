shonda_3088,"All I see is people criticizing her bc she likes to brag about how she’s loved by her husband and children…
Which is mind boggling to me bc what’s wrong with that.. maybe she grew up not ever feeling love.. maybe she grew up not knowing what that feels like..
If a journalist is asking questions about her husband and how he makes her feel or how she feels, why can’t she say He loves me so much and my children love me so much… why does she have to vocalize her love for them..this is typically always a given..
She loves her children clearly..She loves her husband clearly.. BUT the biggest thing for her is that she is LOVED back if not more..

chubbycheeksinthepeaks,I want to like her but she's obsessed with herself. Harry loves ME. A TV series solely about ME. Only shows up to events to speak about herself. Only goes to award shows where she is being honoured. It just feels like she's on the take all the time. Where is all this humanitarian work or philanthropic work she did to gain these accolades? Or was it just as simple as writing a cheque? This many people aren't wrong. Her energy is off. The aura ain't good. The eyes are dull.

converso.natalie.london,"I think that this has, very sadly, become a story of a woman who was (and remains) deeply insecure. She had a tiny bit of fame and Hollywood pizzazz and she thought she could go husband shopping - she landed a big fish - the big fish happened to have some pretty big hang ups. She thought she could rock the English world - which she had no time or respect to learn about before she entered - and then wondered why they put her in her place. When she WAS put in her place - she played every card available to her including the race one. This is the work of a manipulative, narcissistic, self absorbed person. I feel deeply sorry for Harry because I think he has made some grave mistakes but I think he has been controlled and coerced. Diana must be so disappointed- not in him - but in the way this has played out - Megan is an embarrassment and has cost the royal family way too much. I fear that in their attempt to embrace being modern - they have achieved their downfall.",1763716996,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/DRSssyVEuwk,"Meghan Markle says ""no one in the world"" loves her more than Prince Harry — and the feeling is very much mutual!

koulak,I hope he loves her enough to put up with her narcissistic personality. He gave up crown and country and the silver spoon to be with her. I hope she is still enough for him in 10 years time because I saw a very tired looking Meghan in the magazine shoot. She looked weirdly older. All the lying must be catching up with her and it’s showing. Just my opinion. I might be wrong. I didn’t expect him to leave his UK army connections for a woman but there you have it. She must be something extraordinary for him to show this extraordinary devotion.,1763684106,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/DRSssyVEuwk,"Meghan Markle says ""no one in the world"" loves her more than Prince Harry — and the feeling is very much mutual!

_dianaveladeleon,I can't even articulate the gumption of women who dare to write such ugliness and press send. Im so confused why women hate her. Can someone please give me some idea what Megan has done to them to make these women hate her? The only thing I can think of is her interview with Oprah that didn't go well.

abosman3,"There are a lot of comments going both directions. Some people love her and some people don’t. Personally I was rooting for her in the beginning and I felt for her when she first spoke about how her mental health had been affected (think during her first pregnancy), but she’s just started to irk me. I don’t know why. The most recent moments just come off as forced, fake and far from authentic.

fulmer75,"Jesus Christ people these articles pick quotes to cause rage bait and Meagan  to be targeted for hatred. Of course she loves Harry, that’s why she’s saying such amazing things about him. They don’t share their children with us because they would be targeted with the same hatred. Harry was a literal spare in the royal family and lost his mother at such a young age and had to watch people say terrible things about her while he watch his dad move on with the woman was having an affair with his father. I find it very strange that Harry and mostly Meaghan are villains for leaving the royal court behind but the King and Camilla have done way worse and no one bats an eye. Princess Di would be so happy for both her boys. Harry for getting his beautiful family and freedom and William for having his beautiful family and hopefully being the new face of the crown. She would only be sad that they aren’t as close but that was years in the making with or without Meaghan. Harry in William’s shadow with no true freedom or sense of self would never of been happy.",1763676704,137,https://www.instagram.com/p/DRSssyVEuwk,"Meghan Markle says ""no one in the world"" loves her more than Prince Harry — and the feeling is very much mutual!
