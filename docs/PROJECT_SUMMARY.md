# ET SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE

**Transform ET's comment section from vanity metrics into strategic market intelligence**

---

## The One-Sentence Pitch

We analyze millions of ET social comments to tell Paramount executives which talent is gaining trust, which storylines are fatiguing audiences, and where reputation risks are emerging—before they become crises.

---

## Before / After

### Before
**Question**: "Is Blake Lively safe for our new CBS show given the It Ends With Us controversy?"

**Current Process**:
- Check Twitter trends (not representative of mass market)
- Commission focus groups ($50K, takes 3 weeks)
- Rely on gut feel and anecdotes
- Make $10M+ casting decision with incomplete data

**Answer**: Uncertain. Decision delayed or made with high risk.

---

### After
**Question**: "Is Blake Lively safe for our new CBS show?"

**New Process**:
- Query ET Intelligence System (5 minutes)
- Review 30-day sentiment trend + velocity alerts
- See actual mass-market audience reaction (not Twitter bubbles)
- Compare to other talent options with data

**Answer**: "Blake's sentiment dropped 42% in 72 hours around lawsuit news but stabilized at +0.3 (positive) over last 14 days. Risk: Medium. Comparable talent: [ranked list with sentiment scores]."

**Decision made in hours with confidence, not weeks with uncertainty.**

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Mass-Market Sentiment Tracking**
- Analyzes ET's Instagram/YouTube comments (millions of data points)
- Understands entertainment language ("she ate" = positive, handles sarcasm)
- Tracks 8 emotions: excitement, love, anger, disappointment, disgust, fatigue, surprise, neutral

### 2. **Velocity Alerts (The "Risk Radar")**
- Flags ±30% sentiment changes within 72 hours
- Early warning system for reputation issues
- Automated monitoring—no manual checking

### 3. **Entity Intelligence**
- Auto-detects celebrities, shows, IP mentioned
- Tracks relationships (Taylor+Travis, Blake+It Ends With Us)
- Measures "storyline fatigue" (when audiences are over it)

## Business Value

**Problem**: Paramount makes $10M+ decisions based on incomplete data (Twitter ≠ general audience), expensive research ($50K focus groups), and gut feel.

**Solution**: Real-time mass-market intelligence from ET's audience. Costs <$100/month vs. $50K+ traditional research.

**Use Cases**:
1. Talent Risk Assessment - "Is [celebrity] safe for our project?"
2. Marketing Validation - "Is our campaign resonating or fatiguing?"
3. Damage Control - Velocity alerts flag problems before crisis
4. Content Strategy - What storylines excite vs. exhaust audiences?

---

## Competitive Advantage

1. **Data Moat**: ET's audience = proprietary dataset competitors can't replicate
2. **Entertainment Context**: Tuned for celebrity culture, not generic sentiment
3. **Velocity Focus**: Real-time alerts vs. static snapshots
4. **Cost Efficiency**: <$100/month vs. $50K+ alternatives
